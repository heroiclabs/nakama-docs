== Recovery

When you run into a problem, the best place to start is having Nakama logging its output to standard error (as well as the log files in the `data` directory):

[source,bash]
----
nakama --verbose
----

== Check the log

The log file’s location is dependent on your system configuration and how you started Nakama.

* If you started Nakama on a terminal rather than from a startup script, it will log to the `data` directory. By default it will write to `nakama-xxxx` but this may be overridden with the `--data-dir` and `--name` startup option.
* If your Linux system uses `systemd`, use `journalctl` to view the log:

[source,bash]
----
journalctl -u nakama
----

* If you installed Nakama through a package manager on a system that does not use `systemd`, then you may have to check where it’s configured to log. It’s very likely this will be in the `/var/log/` directory (i.e., `/var/log/nakama`).

The log may give you information on what caused the issue.

== How to submit a bug report

We use GitHub for issue tracking: https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/issues. If you want to report a suspected bug in Nakama, open an issue there.

The most important things for you to provide for us are:

* The full output from `nakama --version`, something like:

[source,bash]
----
0.11.0-dev+0ae55d4
----

* The full backtrace from the crash, if it’s available in the logs.
* The full output from `uname -a`
* Output of the `doctor` command:

[source,bash]
----
# this saves the output to a log file named 'doctor.log' in the current working directory
nakama doctor > doctor.log
----

You can optionally connect to a remote Nakama node to obtain additional information about it:

[source,bash]
----
nakama doctor <IP Address>:<Ops Port>
----
