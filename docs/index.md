# Nakama server

Nakama is a scalable server for social and realtime games and apps.

With Nakama server you can add user authentication, social networking, storage, and realtime data exchange into your apps and games. It is developed by <a href="https://heroiclabs.com" target="\_blank">Heroic Labs</a> to handle the difficult but essential services that go into all social and realtime games and apps.

The server is designed to run at massive scale. Nakama works as a <a href="https://heroiclabs.com/nakama-enterprise/" target="\_blank">distributed cluster</a> so when your game or app gets featured in the App Store then all you need do is launch a few more instances and you'll handle the extra load with ease.

During development you can run the server on your macOS, Linux, or Windows machine. When it's time to move into production either move into the cloud or use the Heroic Labs <a href="https://heroiclabs.com/managed-cloud/" target="\_blank">Managed cloud</a> service.

## Features

You get to focus on building your project while the server handles all [user accounts](user-accounts.md), [social profiles](authentication.md#social-providers), [realtime chat](social-realtime-chat.md), [data storage](storage-collections.md), [multiplayer matches](gameplay-multiplayer-realtime.md), and lots more.

__Server-side code__

The server integrates the Lua programming language as a fast embedded [code runtime](runtime-code-basics.md).

This is useful to run custom logic which isn't running on the device or browser. The code you deploy with the server can be used immediately by clients so you can change behavior on the fly and add new features faster.

## Next steps

Build the next big hit for mobile, console, desktop, and web with Nakama. We have first-class game engine integration including [Unity](unity-client-guide.md) for ease of development.

To get the most out of Nakama you should follow the rest of this guide. And if you need help <a href="mailto:support@heroiclabs.com">get in touch</a> with the Heroic Labs team about our developer training.

The first step to building your project with Nakama is to [install it](install-docker-quickstart.md).
