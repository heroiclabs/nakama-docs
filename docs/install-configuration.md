# Configuration

A YAML configuration file configures many aspects of how your Nakama server runs. You can run Nakama without specifying a configuration file and rely on the the default settings instead.

## Specifying a config file
You can specify a configuration file at run-time using --config flag.

```shell fct_label="Shell"
nakama --config my-special-config.yml
```

If you are running Nakama via Docker-Compose, you'll need to bind a folder in your machine so that it's available in Docker. Follow this guide to [setup folder binding](install-docker-quickstart.md#data).

## Nakama port usage

Nakama is a very flexible system. You can exchange data with the server over gRPC, HTTP, Websockets and rUDP. Due to this flexibilty, Nakama requires 4 ports to be available to bind to:

- HTTP API server on port 7350. *Port can be changed in the config.*
- HTTP API server powering the embedded developer console on port 7351. *Port can be changed in the config.*
- gRPC API server on port 7349. *Port is chosen based on the API server port.*
- gRPC API server for the embedded console on port 7348. *Port is chosen based on the API server port.*

We'll be reducing the port requirement in the future releases.

## Common properties

There are a few configuration properties that need to be changed in most environments. The full list of configurations is at the [bottom of the page](#server-configuration).

| Parameter | Description
| --------- | -----------
| `name` | Nakama node name (must be unique) - It will default to `nakama`.
| `data_dir` | An absolute path to a writeable folder where Nakama will store its data, including logs. Default value is the working directory that Nakama was started on.
| `runtime.path` | Path of modules to scan and load. Defaults to `data_dir/modules`.
| `database.address` | List of database nodes to connect to. It should follow the form of `username:password@address:port/dbname` (`postgres://` protocol is appended to the path automatically). Defaults to `root@localhost:26257`.
| `socket.server_key` | Server key to use to establish a connection to the server. Default value is `defaultkey`.
| `runtime.http_key` | Key is used to protect the server's runtime HTTP invocations. Default value is `defaultkey`.
| `session.encryption_key` | The encryption key used to produce the client token. Default value is `defaultencryptionkey`.
| `session.token_expiry_sec` | Session token expiry in seconds. Default value is 60.


!!! warning "Production settings"
    You must change the values of **`socket.server_key`**, **`session.encryption_key`** and **`runtime.http_key`** before you deploy Nakama to a live production environment.

    Follow the [production settings deployment guide](deployment-production-settings.md) for more information.

## Server Configuration

Nakama has various configuration options to make it as flexible as possible for various use cases and deployment environments.

Nakama ships with sane default values for all config options, therefore you'll only need to override a subset of the options. You can also setup your own config file, and override the values in the config file via command-line flags. For instance, to override Runtime Path:

```shell fct_label="Shell"
nakama --runtime.path /tmp/my-modules
```

If fields are not specific, default values will be used. For more information on how to override flags, have a look at the [server command-line](install-server-cli.md) page.

!!! tip "Override configuration"
    Every configuration option can set from a config file, as a command line flag or both where the command-line argument takes precedence and will override the configuration values.

| Parameter | Flag | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| `name` | `name` | Nakama node name (must be unique) - It will default to `nakama`. This name is also used in the log files.
| `data_dir` | `data_dir` | An absolute path to a writeable folder where Nakama will store its data, including logs. Default value is the working directory that Nakama was started on.

### Logger

Nakama produces logs in JSON format so various systems can interact with the logs. By default they are written to the standard out (console).

| Parameter | Flag | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| `level` | `logger.level` | Minimum log level to produce. Values are `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`. Default is `info`.
| `stdout` | `logger.stdout` | Redirect logs to console standard output. The log file will no longer be used. Default is `true`.
| `file` | `log.verbose` | Log output to a file (as well as `stdout` if set). Make sure that the directory and the file is writable.

The standard startup log messages will always be printed to the console irrespective of the value of `logger.stdout` field.

### Metrics

Nakama produces metrics information. This information can be exported to Stackdriver or Prometheus.

| Parameter | Flag | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| `reporting_freq_sec` | `metrics.reporting_freq_sec` | Frequency of metrics exports. Default is 10 seconds.
| `namespace` | `metrics.namespace` | Namespace for Prometheus or prefix for Stackdriver metrics. It will always prepend node name. Default value is empty.
| `stackdriver_projectid` | `metrics.stackdriver_projectid` | This is the identifier of the Stackdriver project the server is uploading the stats data to. Setting this enables metrics to be exported to Stackdriver.
| `prometheus_port` | `metrics.prometheus_port` | Port to expose Prometheus. Default value is '0' which disables Prometheus exports.

Ensure that metrics exports are protected as they contain sensitive server information.

### Database

Nakama requires a CockroachDB server instance to be available. Nakama creates and manages its own database called `nakama` within the CockroachDB database.

| Parameter | Flag | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| `address` | `database.address` | List of database nodes to connect to. It should follow the form of `username:password@address:port/dbname` (`postgres://` protocol is appended to the path automatically). Defaults to `root@localhost:26257`.
| `conn_max_lifetime_ms` | `database.conn_max_lifetime_ms` | Time in milliseconds to reuse a database connection before the connection is killed and a new one is created.. Default value is 0 (indefinite).
| `max_open_conns` | `database.max_open_conns` | Maximum number of allowed open connections to the database. Default value is 0 (no limit).
| `max_idle_conns` | `database.max_idle_conns` | Maximum number of allowed open but unused connections to the database. Default value is 100.

!!! tip "Database addresses"
    You can pass in multiple database addresses to Nakama via command like:

    ```
    nakama --database.address "root@db1:26257" --database.address "root@db2:26257"
    ```

### Runtime

!!! warning "Important"
    You must change `http_key` before going live with your app!

!!! tip "Runtime env value"
    The runtime environment is a key-value pair. They are separated by the `=` character like this:

    ```
    nakama --runtime.env "key=value" --runtime.env "key2=value2" --runtime.env "key3=valuecanhave=sign"
