= Running Nakama server

Once you have link:./install[installed Nakama^], you'll be able to use the `nakama` command to start, stop and manage the Nakama server.

== Starting a server

Running Nakama on your development machine is simple.

NOTE: If you installed Nakama using Docker, you'll need to follow the link:../install./docker.adoc[Docker-specific instructions] for starting Nakama.

First, you need to run CockroachDB:

[source,bash]
----
# Start CockroachDB
cockroach start --background --insecure --store=attrs=ssd,path=/tmp/cockroach
----

Next, prepare Nakama's data schema:

[source,bash]
----
# Run the one-time Nakama database migration setup
nakama migrate up
----

Then start Nakama itself:

[source,bash]
----
# Start Nakama server
nakama
----

Each subsequent time you start Nakama, you don't need to run the `migrate` step unless you're upgrading to a new version of Nakama.

Once Nakama is running, you can connect to it from the client on port `7350`. To view Nakama's built-in dashboard, navigate to `http://localhost:7351`.

=== Nakama run-time options

Nakama has just a few run-time options, to make it as easy as possible to run and develop against. You can also specify each of these options in a persistent link:./configure[configuration file^].

Nakama's run-time options:

* `--config`: Absolute path to a configuration file.
* `--db`: Fully qualified JDBC address to a CockroachDB server. This is in the form of `jdbc://user:password@hostname:port`.
* `--data-dir`: Data directory to store server data. Absolute path to a writeable folder.
* `--name`: Unique node name. This name is also used in the log files.
* `--port`: The port to listen on when accepting connections from the client. Listens on all interfaces by default. Unless explicitly defined, other ports will be chosen sequentially from here upwards.
* `--ops-port`: The port to listen on when accepting connections for the ops dashboard. Listens on all interfaces by default.

Here's an example using all the run-time flags:

[source,bash]
----
# Start Nakama server
nakama --config=/path/to/config.yml --db=jdbc://user:password@hostname:port --data-dir=/path/to/data --name=nakama-demo1 --port=7896 --ops-port=6987
----

And here's the output that we'd expect to see:

[source,bash]
----
[I] Nakama starting at=2017-04-07 13:07:50.322 +0000 UTC
[I] Node name=nakama-92e1 version=0.12.1+aab3e2e
[I] Data directory path=/path/to/data-dir/data
[I] Database connections dsns=[root@localhost:26257]
[W] DB schema outdated, run `nakama migrate up` migrations=2
[I] Ops port=9646
[I] Dashboard url=http://localhost:7350
[I] Client port=7351
[I] Startup done
----

For development on your local machine, that's all you need to get Nakama server started. Next let's take a look at link:./operate.adoc[operating Nakama].

== Start a cluster [local]

Nakama is designed to run in production as a highly available cluster. You can start a cluster locally on your development machine if you're running Nakama Enterprise. In production you can use either Nakama Enterprise or our managed cloud service.

NOTE: *Nakama Enterprise*
Read more about https://heroiclabs.com/services/#enterprise[Nakama Enterprise] and https://heroiclabs.com/managed-cloud/[Managed Cloud].

To create a cluster, you'll need two additional ports:

. An inter-node communication port.
. A gossip port to enable discovery and mesh connectivity across the network.

Let's start multiple Nakama servers on the same machine and connect them together.

[source,bash]
----
# Start the first Nakama server
nakama --name "node1"
----

[source,bash]
----
# Start the second Nakama server and connect
# it to the first one to form a cluster
nakama --name "node2" --port 7360 --join 127.0.0.1:7352
----

The instances of Nakama running on your machine are now connected as a cluster.

== Start a cluster [cloud]

In production, each Nakama node must run on a separate machine..

NOTE: *Nakama Enterprise*
Clustering multiple servers is available in https://heroiclabs.com/services/#enterprise[Nakama Enterprise] and https://heroiclabs.com/managed-cloud/[Managed Cloud].

When a Nakama server first connects to a cluster, you need to provie it with the IP address of at least one other Nakama server.

You should do this using a link:../configure.adoc[configuration file]. Under the `join` parameter, you can list one or more existing Nakama servers that your new node should connect to:

[source,yml]
----
join:
  - 10.0.0.1:7352
  - 10.0.0.2:7352
  - 10.0.0.3:7352
  - server_ip_or_host:gossip_port
----

You don't need to list every node in the cluster. The Nakama nodes will automatically exchange information and help new nodes discover other cluster members.

In production you should run at least three Nakama servers in a cluster, to ensure availability.

== Next steps

Now that you know how to configure and run Nakama, you can either dive into the other link:./advanced.adoc[command-line options] available or get started with your first API calls.
