= Start Server

Nakama is designed with development and operation simplicity in mind.

You need to have a CockroachDB server running before starting Nakama. CockroachDB is an open source survivable SQL database. You can download CockroachDB https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/install-cockroachdb.html[here^].

== Start a server

[source,bash]
----
# Start CockroachDB
cockroach start --background --insecure --store=attrs=ssd,path=/tmp/cockroach

# Run the one-time Nakama database migration setup
nakama migrate up

# Start Nakama server
nakama
----

You can now connect to the Nakama Server from the client on port `7350`. You can view Nakama's built-in dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:7351`.

== Start a cluster [local]

Nakama can connect to other Nakama servers to form a highly available cluster.

NOTE: *Nakama Enterprise*
Connecting and clustering multiple servers is available in https://heroiclabs.com/services/#enterprise[Nakama Enterprise] and https://heroiclabs.com/managed-cloud/[Managed Cloud].

Clustering is built into Nakama and it requires two extra ports:

. An inter-node communication port to enable different Nakama servers to exchange information with each other.
. A gossip port to enable discovery and mesh connectivity across the network.

You can start multiple Nakama servers on the same machine and connect them together.

[source,bash]
----
# Start the first Nakama server
nakama --name "node1"
----

[source,bash]
----
# Start the second Nakama server and connect
# it to the first one to form a cluster
nakama --name "node2" --port 7360 --join 127.0.0.1:7352
----

== Start a cluster [cloud]

You can connect multiple Nakama servers on different machines to form a cluster.

NOTE: *Nakama Enterprise*
Connecting and clustering multiple servers is available in https://heroiclabs.com/services/#enterprise[Nakama Enterprise] and https://heroiclabs.com/managed-cloud/[Managed Cloud].

In production, we recommend that you setup configuration parameters within a link:../configure.adoc[configuration file]. You'd need to change the config file to include the following:

[source,yml]
----
join:
  - 10.0.0.1:7352
  - 10.0.0.2:7352
  - 10.0.0.3:7352
  - server_ip_or_host:gossip_port
----

You don't need to explicitly join every node in the cluster. Nakama nodes will automatically exchange information and help new nodes discover other cluster members.

We recommend that you run at least a minimum of three Nakama servers in production.
