= Installing Nakama using Docker

Installing Nakama using Docker is ideal for a few reasons, including:

* you install to a pristine environment
* you get everything you need in one go, including CockroachDB
* you can take snapshots, re-install and remove Nakama without affecting your primary operating system.

It also means that the installation instructions are the same whether your development machine runs Windows, MacOS and Linux.

== What is Docker?

If you're new to Docker, then here's what you need to know: Docker is an open soure containerization tool that lets you create multiple distinct Linux environments, each separate from the other. 

In a Docker container you run a suite of tools to do a particular job; in this case we'll have one container running Nakama and another running CockroachDB. You can think of Docker containers as lightweight virtual machines.

That's all you need to know to follow this installation guide but you can https://www.docker.com/what-docker[learn more about Docker] on their website.

=== Installing Docker on your development machine

For Nakama, you should install Docker Community Edition.

NOTE: for some versions of Windows you'll need to use https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox[Docker Toolbox] instead. See our link:./windows.adoc[Windows guide] for more details.

Take a look in the Docker Store to find the right version of https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&q=&type=edition[Docker Community Edition for your environment].

== Installing Nakama

We'll be using Docker Compose, which comes bundled with Docker Community Edition.

Docker Compose simplifies running more than one Docker container in conjunction. For Nakama, we'll need two containers: one for Nakama itself and one for the database it relies on, CockroachDB.

NOTE: You can choose to configure the https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama/[Nakama] and https://hub.docker.com/r/cockroachdb/cockroach/[CockroachDB] containers without Docker Compose but we do not recommend it when you're starting out.

== Run Nakama with Docker Compose

Once you have Docker Community Edition installed, and you've followed the post-install instructions for your platform, you can get to installing the Nakama.

Docker Compose uses YAML configuration files to declare which containers to use and how they should work together.

1. Let's start by downloading the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heroiclabs/nakama/master/install/docker/docker-compose.yml[Nakama Docker Compose file^]:
+
[source,bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heroiclabs/nakama/master/install/docker/docker-compose.yml
----
+
This will download `docker-compose.yml` to your current working directory.
+
2. Next, we'll ask Docker Compose to follow the instructions in the file we just downloaded:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----
+
Docker Compose will now download the latest CockroachDB and Nakama images published on Docker Hub.
+
3. If everything went smoothly, you now have both CockroachDB and Nakama running on your machine, available at `127.0.0.1:7350` and `127.0.0.1:26257` respectively. Confirm that Nakama is running by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:7351[http://127.0.0.1:7351^] where you should see the Nakama dashboard.

=== Logs

Logs generated within the containers are printed to the console as part of the `docker-compose` output, and you cann access them with `docker-compose logs` from within the same the directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.

=== Specifying where to host your data

Docker containers are ephemeral by design: when you shut them down, you lose the data stored inside them.

That's not a problem if you're just testing things out but for development work you should configure your containers to host your data on your local file system.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/[Follow the Docker documentation^] to learn how to work with Docker data volumes, and host your Nakama and CockroachDB data outside the container.

== Upgrading

As new versions of Nakama, or CockroachDB, become available you might want to upgrade. 

IMPORTANT: You should back-up your data before upgrading. See below for instructions on back-up your data.

Upgrading with Docker is simple, as everything is handled by the Docker Compose script. 

To grab the latest version of Nakama you simply need to re-run the Docker Compose process. This will pull down the most recent container image and migrate the data to the most recent Nakama format. 

WARNING: When you upgrade the container images, any data stored in the containers will be deleted. Make sure you follow the xref:specifying-where-to-host-your-data[instructions above to store your data in your host operating system].

=== Backing-up your data

Before you upgrade, you should back-up the data that Nakama has stored in CockroachDB. To do so, follow the https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/back-up-data.html[back-up instructions in the CockroachDB documentation^].

=== Getting the latest Docker images

Once you've completed your back-up, you can pull down the most recent Nakama image and allow Docker Compose to perform the data migration.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose down # top and remove both the Nakama and CockroachDB containers
docker pull heroiclabs/nakama # download the latest Nakama image
docker-compose up # start the containers (both Nakama and CockroachDB) as fresh installs
----

And, similarly, here's how to update the CockroachDB container:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose down # stop and remove both the Nakama and CockroachDB containers
docker pull cockroachdb/cockroach # download the latest CockroachDB image
docker-compose up # start the containers (both Nakama and CockroachDB) as fresh installs
----

== Stopping the containers

If you need to temporarily pause the Docker containers, without losing the state of those containers, you have two options:

* In the terminal where `docker-compose` is currently running, hit `CTRL-C`.
* Or run `docker-compose stop` in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml` and all containers will be shut down gracefully.

You can re-activate them by running `docker-compose up`.

To stop the containers and purge all stored data, run `docker-compose down`.


== Connecting the Nakama client

When you come to connect to your Docker-hosted Nakama instance, you'll need to use these locations:

* *Nakama server endpoint:* `127.0.0.1:7350`
* *Nakama dashboard:* http://127.0.0.1:8080[http://127.0.0.1:8080^]

Although you won't need to interact directly with CockroachDB, you can find it at:

* *CockroachDB server endpoint:* `127.0.0.1:26257`
* *CockroachDB dashboard:* http://127.0.0.1:8080[http://127.0.0.1:8080^]

== Next steps

Now you can start developing your application with Nakama. Let's take a look at link:../development[Nakama Clients].
