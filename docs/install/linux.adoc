= Linux

There are two ways to install Nakama on Linux-based operating systems:

* using link:./docker.adoc[Docker]
* directly installing the binaries.

We recommend you install Nakama on your development machine using link:./docker.adoc[Docker].

NOTE: These binaries have been installed and tested on Ubuntu/Debian. If you're using another Linux distro then you can link:https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama[build the the binary yourself^].

== Binary installation

First you'll need to create a suitable directory to install Nakama. To some extent its location will depend on your particular flavor of Linux and your own preferences. 

Once that directory exists, you need to install CockroachDB, which is a prerequisit of Nakama.

. Download the latest https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-latest.linux-amd64.tgz[CockroachDB tarball for Linux].
. Then extract the binary:
+
[source,bash]
----
tar xfz cockroach-latest.linux-amd64.tgz
----
. Now put the binary into your `PATH` so it's easy to execute https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroach-commands.html[cockroach commands] from anywhere:
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -i cockroach-latest.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin
----

NOTE: You might need to perform some of these actions `root`. Use `sudo` or `su root` if necessary.

Now you can download and install the Nakama binary.

. Download the latest https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases/latest[Nakama tarball for Linux^].
. Then extract the binary:
+
[source,bash]
----
tar xfz nakama-X.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz # replace the X.X.X with the version number you have downloaded
----
+
. Again we'll add the directory containing the binary to your `PATH`.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -i nakama /usr/local/bin
----
+

=== systemd

If you prefer to run Nakama as a service, and you're running a distro that uses `systemd`, you can optionally use this script.

If you plan to use a custom configuration, youâ€™ll have to create the link:../../configure.adoc[configuration] files manually.

. First, create the service file, `/usr/lib/systemd/system/nakama.service`:
+
NOTE: You'll need to update the paths within the systemd configuration.

+
[source,bash]
----
[Unit]
Description=Nakama server

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/nakama --config /path/to/nakama/config.yml
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----
The `chmod` for this file should be 644 (`sudo chmod 644 /usr/lib/systemd/system/nakama.service`).

. Enable and run the service:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl enable nakama
sudo systemctl start nakama
----

The `ExecStart` prompt needs to point to the Nakama binary on the host machine. Just as when running Nakama in the terminalm you can apply a `--config` flag and file to `ExecStart`.

=== Docker

You can also follow our link:./docker.adoc[Docker guide] to run Nakama as a container.

== Next stage

Once both CockroachDB and Nakama are installed you can link:../../start-server.adoc[start the server].
