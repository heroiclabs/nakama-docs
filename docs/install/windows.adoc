= Windows

Windows is a great environment for developing your game with Nakama. To install Nakama on your Windows machine you'll need to use link:./docker.adoc[Docker].

== Windows version requirements

For Windows development environments, there are two versions of Docker:

* *https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&q=&type=edition[Docker Community Edition]:* https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install[requires] 64 bit Windows 10 pro and Microsoft Hyper-V].
* *https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox[Docker Toolbox]:* runs on previous versions of Windows.

Once you've installed the version of Docker that's right for your Windows environment, you should follow our standard link:./docker.adoc[guide to installing Nakama with Docker].

== Binary installation

Nakama is also available as a https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases/latest[Windows binary]. However, Nakama relies on CockroachDB, which is unavailable for Windows. You could choose to install the Nakama binary natively on Windows and CockroachDB as a Docker container but we don't recommend that method.

== Next steps

Install Nakama by following our link:./docker.adoc[Docker install guide].
