= Upgrades

When upgrading to a new version of Nakama, you need to do three things before you run the newer version:

 * Check the https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases[release notes^], in case that version has specific upgrade requirements. 
 * Migrate your data to the format supported by the new version of Nakama.
 * Ensure that the client version you're running is compatible with the server deployed.

NOTE: If you're running Nakama in a Docker container, follow the link:../install/docker.adoc[dedicated upgrade instructions for Docker installs].
