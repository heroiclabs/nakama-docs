# Unity client guide

The official Unity client handles all communication in realtime with the server. It implements all features in the server and is compatible with Unity 2017 or newer. To work with our Unity client you'll need to install and setup [Unity engine](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

With the Nakama 2.x release we've split out the Unity client into a lower level client for .NET and a new wrapper client which will require Unity 2017 or greater.

1. Nakama .NET client library: A lower level .NET library that you can use directly inside your Unity Project. This will give you complete control over sending and receiving responses from the server, updating your scene and more. You can look at the source code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama).
2. Nakama Unity client library: A wrapper around the .NET client library that integrates more tightly into the Unity Engine, and will take of client reconnection, messag queuing and interacting with Unity lifecycle events. This is currently going through final API design and will be made available soon to the public.

!!! info "Nakama 2.x release"
    With the Nakama 2.x release we've split out the Unity client into a lower level client for .NET and a new wrapper which will require Unity 2017 or greater. The new Unity client is not released yet but will be announced on our [blog](https://blog.heroiclabs.com/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heroicdev). In the meantime you can use the .NET client directly and is available [here](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-dotnet).

## Download

The client is available on the <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/81338" target="\_blank">Unity Asset store</a> and also on <a href="https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-unity/releases/latest" target="\_blank">GitHub releases</a>. You can download "Nakama.unitypackage" which contains all source code and DLL dependencies required in the client code.

## Install and setup

When you've [downloaded](#download) the "Nakama.unitypackage" file you should drag or import it into your Unity editor project to install it. In the editor create a new C# script via the Assets menu with "Assets > Create > C# Script" and create an `INClient`.

The client object is used to execute all logic against the server.

```csharp
using Nakama;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class NakamaSessionManager : MonoBehaviour {
  void Start() {
    var client = new Client("defaultkey", "127.0.0.1", 7350, false);
  }

  void Update() {
  }
}
```

Unity uses an entity component system (ECS) which makes it simple to share the client across game objects. Have a read of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ControllingGameObjectsComponents.html" target="\_blank">Controlling GameObjects Using Components</a> for examples on how to share a C# object across your game objects.

## Authenticate

With a client object you can authenticate against the server. You can register or login a [user](user-accounts.md) with one of the [authenticate options](authentication.md).

To authenticate you should follow our recommended pattern in your client code:

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1\. Build an instance of the client.

```csharp
var client = new Client("defaultkey", "127.0.0.1", 7350, false);
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; 2\. Authenticate a user. By default, Nakama will try and create a user if it doesn't exist.

Use the following code to store the session:

```csharp
const string email = "hello@example.com";
const string password = "somesupersecretpassword";
var session = await client.AuthenticateEmailAsync(email, password);
PlayerPrefs.SetString("nk.session", session.AuthToken);
Debug.LogFormat("Authenticated successfully. User id {0}:", session.user_id);
```

In the code above we use `AuthenticateEmailAsync` but for other authentication options have a look at the [code examples](authentication.md#register-or-login).

A __full example__ class with all code above is [here](#full-example).

## Send messages

When a user has been authenticated a session is used to connect with the server. You can then send messages for all the different features in the server.

This could be to [add friends](social-friends.md), join [groups](social-groups-clans.md), or submit scores in [leaderboards](gameplay-leaderboards.md). You can also execute remote code on the server via [RPC](runtime-code-basics.md).

The server also provides a [storage engine](storage-collections.md) to keep save games and other records owned by users. We'll use storage to introduce how messages are sent.

```js
var object = new WriteStorageObject = {
  "collection" = "collection",
  "key" ="key1",
  "value" = "{\"jsonKey\": \"jsonValue\"}"
};
const storageWriteAck = await client.WriteStorageObjectsAsync(session, objects);
Debug.LogFormat("Storage write was successful: {0}", storageWriteAck);
```

Have a look at other sections of documentation for more code examples.

## Realtime data exchange

You can connect to the server over a realtime WebSocket connection to send and receive [chat messages](social-realtime-chat.md), get [notifications](social-in-app-notifications.md), and [matchmake](gameplay-matchmaker.md) into a [multiplayer match](gameplay-multiplayer-realtime.md). You can also execute remote code on the server via [RPC](runtime-code-basics.md).

You first need to create a realtime socket to the server:

```csharp
// Updated example TBD
```

Then proceed to join a chat channel and send a message:

```csharp
// Updated example TBD
```

You can find more information about the various chat features available [here](social-in-app-notifications.md).

## Handle events

A client socket has event listeners which are called on various events received from the server.

```csharp
// Updated example TBD
```

Some events only need to be implemented for the features you want to use.

| Callbacks | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| ondisconnect | Handles an event for when the client is disconnected from the server. |
| onerror | Receives events about server errors. |
| onnotification | Receives live [in-app notifications](social-in-app-notifications.md) sent from the server. |
| onchannelmessage | Receives [realtime chat](social-realtime-chat.md) messages sent by other users. |
| onchannelpresence | It handles join and leave events within [chat](social-realtime-chat.md). |
| onmatchdata | Receives [realtime multiplayer](gameplay-multiplayer-realtime.md) match data. |
| onmatchpresence | It handles join and leave events within [realtime multiplayer](gameplay-multiplayer-realtime.md). |
| onmatchmakermatched | Received when the [matchmaker](gameplay-matchmaker.md) has found a suitable match. |
| onstatuspresence | It handles status updates when subscribed to a user [status feed](social-status.md). |
| onstreampresence | Receives [stream](social-stream.md) join and leave event. |
| onstreamdata | Receives [stream](social-stream.md) data sent by the server. |

<!--
## Main thread dispatch

The client runs all callbacks on a socket thread separate to the Unity main thread.

Unity engine does not let code which executes on another thread call one of it's APIs because of how it manages code execution within the game loop. This can causes errors which look something like "<SomeMethod\> can only be called from the main thread".

We recommend a simple pattern which can be used to run any code which calls `UnityEngine` APIs.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1\. Add a queue to your script which manages a client.

```csharp
Queue<Action> executionQueue = new Queue<Action>(1024);
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; 2\. Add code in your `Update` method so the queued actions are run.

```csharp
for (int i = 0, l = executionQueue.Count; i < l; i++) {
  executionQueue.Dequeue()();
}
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; 3\. Enqueue any code which uses a `UnityEngine` API.

```csharp
client.Connect(_session, (bool done) => {
  executionQueue.Enqueue(() => {
    Debug.Log("Session connected.");
    // Store session for quick reconnects.
    PlayerPrefs.SetString("nk.session", session.AuthToken); // a UnityEngine API
  });
});
```
You can see a more advanced version of this pattern in the [full example](#full-example).


!!! Tip
    This code pattern is not specific to our client. It's useful for any code which executes on a separate thread with Unity engine.

### Managed client

If you don't care about explicit control over which callbacks are dispatched on the Unity main thread you can wrap your code in a helper class which will handle it for you. The `"NManagedClient"` acts as a proxy for all callbacks.

You must call `.ExecuteActions()` in `Update` with the managed client or no callbacks will ever be run.

```csharp hl_lines="14"
using Nakama;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class NakamaSessionManager : MonoBehaviour {
  private INClient _client;

  public NakamaSessionManager() {
    var client = NClient.Default("defaultkey");
    _client = new NManagedClient(client);
  }

  private void Update() {
    (_client as NManagedClient).ExecuteActions(); // important!
  }
}
```

This makes code simpler to reason about but is slightly less performant than if you control exactly which callbacks use UnityEngine APIs and "move them" onto the main thread with an action queue.

-->

## Logs and errors

The [server](install-configuration.md#log) and the client can generate logs which are helpful to debug code. To log all messages sent by the client you can enable "Trace" when you build an `"IClient"`.

```csharp
var client = new Client("defaultkey");
#if UNITY_EDITOR
  client.Trace(true);
#endif
```

The `#if` preprocessor directives is used so trace is only enabled in Unity editor builds. For more complex directives with debug vs release builds have a look at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html" target="\_blank">Platform dependent compilation</a>.

## Full example

An example class used to manage a session with the Unity client.

```csharp
using Nakama;
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class NakamaSessionManager : MonoBehaviour {
  private IClient _client;
  private ISession _session;

  private Queue<IEnumerator> _executionQueue;

  public NakamaSessionManager() {
    _client = new Client("defaultkey");
    _executionQueue = new Queue<IEnumerator>(1024);
  }

  private async void Awake() {
    _session = RestoreSession();
    if (_session == null) {
      Authenticate();
    }
  }

  private Session RestoreSession() {
    // Lets check if we can restore a cached session.
    var sessionString = PlayerPrefs.GetString("nk.session");
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(sessionString)) {
      return null; // We have no session to restore.
    }

    var session = new Session(sessionString);
    if (session.IsExpired) {
      return null; // We can't restore an expired session.
    }

    return session;
  }

  private async void Authenticate() {
    // See if we have a cached id in PlayerPrefs.
    var id = PlayerPrefs.GetString("nk.id");
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(id)) {
      // We'll use device ID for the user. See other authentication options.
      id = SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier;
      // Store the identifier for next game start.
      PlayerPrefs.SetString("nk.id", id);
    }

    // Use whichever one of the authentication options you want.
    _session = await client.AuthenticateDeviceAsync($"{id}");
    Debug.LogFormat("Session: '{0}'.", session.AuthToken);
  }

  private void Update() {
    lock (_executionQueue) {
      for (int i = 0, len = _executionQueue.Count; i < len; i++) {
        StartCoroutine(_executionQueue.Dequeue());
      }
    }
  }

  private void OnApplicationQuit() {}

  private void Enqueue(Action action) {
    lock (_executionQueue) {
      _executionQueue.Enqueue(ActionWrapper(action));
      if (_executionQueue.Count > 1024) {
        Debug.LogWarning("Queued actions not consumed fast enough.");
        _client.Disconnect();
      }
    }
  }

  private IEnumerator ActionWrapper(Action action) {
    action();
    yield return null;
  }
}
```
