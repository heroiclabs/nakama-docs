= Digital Ocean

You can run Nakama and CockroachDB in a Digital Ocean droplet.

It's recommended to run a DigitalOcean droplet with minimum 4GB of RAM. This guide will show you how to configure Docker and resources together.

== Droplet configuration

Create a new Ubuntu DigitalOcean droplet with the following configurations:

- Image Distribution: Ubuntu 16.04 x64
- 4GB RAM / 60GB SSD Disk
- Optionally add block storage - You'll need this if you'd like to keep your database data intact between restarts.
- Choose a region close to you. Let's select New York 3.
- Add a new SSH Key. *This is important*. Follow https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets[this guide^] if you need to setup a public key.

== Accessing droplet

You can remote access the droplet using `SSH`. There isn't a need for username/password as you've pre-authorized yourself with a public key in the previous step.

Make a note of the IPv4 of the droplet as we'll need it.

[source,bash]
----
ssh root@<IP ADDRESS>
# you are now connected to the droplet through an SSH channel.
# you can type `exit` to close the SSH tunnel.
----

TIP: *Creating a user*
It is recommended that you create a non-root user with sudo privileges. To do this, https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04[follow this guide^].

== Installing Docker Compose

Although we can install Docker Compose from the official Ubuntu repositories, it is several minor versions behind the latest release, so we'll install Docker Compose from the Docker's GitHub repository.

NOTE: **Docker Compose requires Docker**
Docker Compose requires Docker to be installed first. DigitalOcean has a https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04[comprehensive guide^] on installing Docker.

1. We'll check the current release and if necessary, update it in the command below:

[source,bash]
----
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.11.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"
----

2. Next we'll set the permissions:

[source,bash]
----
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
----

3. Then we'll verify that the installation was successful by checking the version:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose -v
----

== Running Nakama

You've now installed Docker and Docker Compose. Follow to the Nakama link:../docker.adoc[Docker installation guide] to deploy and run the containers.
