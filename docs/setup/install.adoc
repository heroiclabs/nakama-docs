= Install

Installing Nakama is very simple as Nakama ships as a single binary.

Currently the Nakama server only supports x86_64 architectures. If you'd like to build from source, please refer to the https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/blob/master/README.md#build-from-source[GitHub ReadMe^].

NOTE: **Nakama requires CockroachDB**
To use Nakama, you also need to install https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/install-cockroachdb.html[CockroachDB^].

== macOS

----

=== Binary

Native binaries are provided for macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) and above.

Please note that you'll need to update the paths within the systemd configuration.
+
[source,bash]
----
[Unit]
Description=Nakama server

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/nakama --config /path/to/nakama/config.yml
KillMode=process
